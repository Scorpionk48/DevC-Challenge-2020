# Week 1
## Python and SQL 
This week we will start with setting up environment and get started with the tool and tech we cover in this course. We will use tool that developers use in their daily life. Have fun experience working like a coder.  
If you prefer to work "offline" let's start with installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). You should choose **Python 3.7 version**.  

Our Goal this week is you should:  
- Understand basic Python  
- How to use Jupyter Notebook  
- Basic SQL  

That's actually a lot of stuff to learn. Let's stay together!
