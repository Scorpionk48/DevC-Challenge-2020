## Session 2: Simple computer vision classification project using Pytorch (CNN):
### Objectives
Fashion MNIST dataset:
- a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples.
- Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes)
- Use pytorch module for Conv2d and Linear:
- 2 layers of CNN (with Relu activation function and max pooling 2D)
- 3 fully connected layers (with Relu activation function)
- Activation function is Relu
- The loss function is cross_entropy
- The optimizer is Adam
- Tensor Board is an convenient visualization tool for insights and hyperparameter tuning.
